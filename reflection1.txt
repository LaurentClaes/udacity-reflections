How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

It helped as you noticed only the parts that changed between a working version
and a non-working version.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

- You can go back to previous version that does not contain unwanted changes.
- You can understand how the program was structured.

Manual commits:

- When you manually commit your changes you they each have a semantic and
independent meaning.

Muti-file commits:

They are useful because the separate changes in those files are logically related


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

With git log you can quickly the last logic changes in your code, by whom and when.
With git diff you can check out out these two versions have changed

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

Because you can always go back to a previous working version

How do you want use git?

I actually want to use it for non-coding projects. Could really enhance
productivity.
