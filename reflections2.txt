What happens when you initialize a repository?

It enhances a simple directory into repository by adding meta data covering the
evolution of the project. You need to do it when you want to start tracking
version and changes of your code.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

It lets you define what is logical unit of code to be committed. It offers more
defining power and flexibility to determine exactly what is a single commit
while maybe solving to different things in parallel. All changes in one file are
part of one commit. They can not be split across commits.
